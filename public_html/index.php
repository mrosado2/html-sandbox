				<p>Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I'll alert the crew. This should be interesting. Ensign Babyface! I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Talk about going nowhere fast. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Besides, you look good in a dress. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.</p>
